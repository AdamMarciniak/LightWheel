POV (Persistence of Vision) Bike Wheel Light 

This is software that runs on an ESP32 and helps it talk to 168 addressable LED's.
The LED's are attached in a plus (+) pattern on the spokes of a bike wheel (90 deg apart)
They update as the wheel spins creating a persistence of vision effect.
At a typical speed of 20 km/h and 2.8 rotations per second and an angular resolution of 1 degree
these lights  update over 1000 times per second to deliver a crisp still image.

A hall effect sensor and magnet are used to determine the right timing.

This runs on a custom PCB i've made that includes an ESP32 with associated power components, flash memory and addressable LED's.

Photos, PCB schematics, blog post and explanation to come!
